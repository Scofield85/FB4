Model predictions of body mass based on observed temperature and daily ration estimates fell within 2 SE of observed mean body masses on seven of nine sampling dates over a 4-mo period. We employed three statistical methods to evaluate the fit between predicted and observed growth. A lack-of-fit test detected no significant lack of fit between simulated and observed body masses; partitioning mean squared error showed that 76% of the variance was due to random variation rather than to systematic errors, and a reliability index indicated agreement between predicted and observed masses within a factor of 1.12. Growth simulations were relatively robust with respect to simulated errors in the input variables temperature and swimming speed, but were sensitive to errors in initial body mass. The model used observed growth to predict cumulative food consumption over the sampling season; the prediction was within 8.5% of an extrapolation from field data. Estimation of consumption rate as a constant proportion of maximum ration for the whole season was shown to be inappropriate; however, three intervals that used different constant proportions of maximum ration fit the data and corresponded to observed changes in bass diet."Salmoniformes,Salmonidae,Lenok,Brachymystax lenok,juvenile and adult,Hartman and Jensen 2016,3,0.303,-0.275,5,15,19,24,0.5,0.1,1,0.0024,-0.192,0.0872,0.69311,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0.172,3,0.212,-0.222,0.631,3,0.0314,0.58,-0.299,1,5500,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,Esociformes,Esocidae,Muskellunge (adult),Esox masquinongy,adult,Bevelheimer et al. 1985,4,0.0126,-0.18,0.06,NA,NA,NA,0.0075,-0.000216,1,0.0026445,-0.18,0.055,0.1222,NA,0,1,0,0,1,0,0.175,1,0.2,NA,NA,1,0.0875,NA,NA,1,3598,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,Mysida,Mysidae,Mysis (adult),Mysis mixta,adult,Rudstam 1988,3,0.036,-0.372,4,8,12,18,0.75,0.4,1,0.00182,-0.161,0.0752,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,1,0.15,0,0,1,0.18,0,0,1,3474,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,Perciformes,Latidae,Nile perch,Lates niloticus,,Kitchell et al. 1997,2,0.3,-0.27,2.65,27.5,38,NA,NA,NA,2,0.004056,-0.2,2.5,38,43,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,0.1819,1,0.104,NA,NA,1,0.068,NA,NA,1,5000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,Gadiformes,Gadidae,North Sea cod,Gadus morhua,,Hansson et al. 1996,2,0.099,-0.195,2.41,13.7,21,NA,NA,NA,2,0.008,-0.172,1.88,21,24,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.25,NA,0.17,1,0.17,NA,NA,1,0.09,NA,NA,1,4184,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,Esociformes,Esocidae,Northern pike (adult),Esox lucius,adult,Bevelheimer et al. 1985,4,0.0244,-0.18,-0.024,NA,NA,NA,0.0125,-0.000326,1,0.0026445,-0.18,0.055,0.1222,NA,0,1,0,0,1,0,0.175,1,0.2,NA,NA,1,0.0875,NA,NA,1,3598,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Northern pikeminnow,Ptychocheilus oregonensis,,Petersen & Ward 1999,3,0.278,-0.197,0,20.1,22.7,27,0.001,0.01,1,0.00165,-0.285,0.105,0.122,NA,0,9.2,0,0,1,0,0.163,1,0.2,NA,NA,1,0.07,NA,NA,1,6703,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,Beloniformes,Scomberesocidae,Pacific Saury  (adult),Cololabis saira,adult,Ito et al. 2004; Mukai et al. 2007,3,0.54,-0.256,5,16,20,30,0.1,0.5,1,0.0033,-0.227,0.02,0.026,NA,12,12.3,0.33,0,2,0.149,0.175,1,0.16,NA,NA,1,0.1,NA,NA,1,9541,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,Beloniformes,Scomberesocidae,Pacific Saury (juvenile) ,Cololabis saira,juvenile,Ito et al. 2004; Mukai et al. 2007,3,0.54,-0.256,5,20,26,30,0.1,0.5,1,0.0033,-0.227,0.02,0.026,NA,12,12.3,0.33,0,2,0.149,0.15,1,0.16,NA,NA,1,0.1,NA,NA,1,9541,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,Acipenseriforemes,Acipenseridae,Pallid sturgeon (juvenile),Scaphirhynchus albus,juvenile,Chipps et al (in prep),2,0.553,-0.326,2.1,28,33,NA,NA,NA,2,0.017,-0.15,1.92,30,35,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,0.13,1,0.1,NA,NA,1,0.04,NA,NA,1,2698,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ACT = 1.5 when Temp is greater 25C,Acipenseriforemes,Acipenseridae,Pallid sturgeon (larvae),Scaphirhynchus albus,larvae,Heironimus and Chipps (in prep),2,0.313,-0.32,1.85,24,30,NA,NA,NA,2,0.017,-0.12,2.07,30,35,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,0.13,1,0.1,NA,NA,1,0.04,NA,NA,1,2736,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,Salmoniformes,Salmonidae,Pink salmon (adult),Oncorhynchus gorbuscha,adult,Beauchamp et al. 1989; 1989,3,0.303,-0.275,3,20,20,24,0.58,0.5,1,0.00143,-0.209,0.086,0.0234,NA,25,1,0.13,0,9.9,0.0405,0.172,3,0.212,-0.222,0.631,3,0.0314,0.58,-0.299,2,NA,5234,7.75,196,6648,0.525,,Cyprinodontiformes,Fundulidae,Plains killifish ,Fundulus zebrinus,,Offill 2003,2,3.5999,-1.1602,2.8847,35,43,NA,NA,NA,2,0.0453,-0.5359,1.5965,43,46,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,0.175,1,0.15,NA,NA,1,0.1,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RTM, SDA, FA and UA are based on suggestions by Hanson et al. 1997 (FB3.0)",Scorpaeniformes,Cottidae,Prickly Sculpin (adult),Cottus asper,adult,Moss 2001 (U Washington M.Sc.),3,0.2325,-0.514,6,18,18,24,0.1075,0.8129,1,0.0021,-0.124,0.0616,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.175,1,0.16,NA,NA,1,0.1,NA,NA,1,"Pred.
