## Welcome to Fish Bioenergetics 4.0

There are two main goals of this website: 
- First, to make the current bioenergetics software available and easy to use; 
- Second, to facilitate the wider use and further development of the bioenergetics approach.

For instructions on getting started, see the [FB Wiki](https://github.com/jim-breck/FB4/wiki)

We hope to add information such as the following:
- Online User's Manual, with full explanations
- List of species for which bioenergetics parameters have been published
- Table of parameter values (a .csv file comes with the code)
- References to published models
- Background material for an online introduction to fish bioenergetics
- Suggestions for fitting bioenergetics models to data
- Ideas for future modifications
